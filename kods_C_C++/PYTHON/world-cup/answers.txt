Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: The ones that are run less amount
of times.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: Probably 10000 already give a best approximation of which teams has
the best potential.
